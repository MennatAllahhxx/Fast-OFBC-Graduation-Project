# DC-DC Conversion

This directory is part of the **Fast-OFBC-Graduation-Project** repository. It contains resources and documentation related to DC-DC converters used in the project.

## Directory Structure

The directory is organized as follows:

- **Isolated Converters**: Contains information and resources related to isolated DC-DC converters.
- **Nonisolated Converters**: Contains information and resources related to non-isolated DC-DC converters.
- **Practical/Synchronous_Buck_Converter**: Contains practical implementation details and resources for the synchronous buck converter.

## Subdirectories

### Isolated Converters

This subdirectory includes various types of isolated DC-DC converters, their design principles, simulation models, and test results. Isolated converters provide galvanic isolation between input and output, which is essential for safety and noise reduction in many applications.

### Nonisolated Converters

This subdirectory covers non-isolated DC-DC converters, including their design methodologies, simulation results, and practical implementations. Non-isolated converters are commonly used in applications where isolation is not a primary concern, providing efficient voltage conversion.

### Practical/Synchronous_Buck_Converter

This subdirectory focuses on the synchronous buck converter, a type of non-isolated DC-DC converter. It includes practical design files, schematics, test results, and implementation details. The synchronous buck converter is known for its high efficiency and is widely used in power management applications.
