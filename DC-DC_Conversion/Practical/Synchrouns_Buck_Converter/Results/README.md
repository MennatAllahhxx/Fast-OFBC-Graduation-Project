## Running the Synchronous Buck Converter Model on MATLAB Simulink using Arduino Uno

To run the Synchronous Buck Converter model on MATLAB Simulink using an Arduino Uno, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

1. **MATLAB and Simulink**: Ensure you have MATLAB and Simulink installed.
2. **Simulink Support Package for Arduino Hardware**: Install the Simulink Support Package for Arduino Hardware.
3. **Arduino Uno**: Have the hardware available and properly connected to your computer.

### Steps

1. **Open MATLAB**: Start MATLAB on your computer.
2. **Open Simulink Model**: Navigate to the Synchronous Buck Converter Simulink model file (not provided in this directory, but assumed to be part of the project) and open it.
3. **Set Up Hardware**:
    - Go to `Tools` > `Run on Target Hardware` > `Prepare to Run`.
    - Select `Arduino Uno` from the list of available hardware.
    - Configure the settings as required for your specific setup.
4. **Build and Deploy**:
    - Click on the `Deploy to Hardware` button in Simulink.
    - Ensure that the Arduino Uno is connected and powered on.
5. **Run the Simulation**:
    - Once the code is deployed, use the Arduino Uno to run the simulation.
    - Observe the results and make any necessary adjustments in the model or the hardware setup.
