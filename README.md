# Fast Off-board Charger for Electric Vehicles

Welcome to the Fast Off-board Charger for Electric Vehicles project! This project aims to develop a robust and efficient off-board charging solution for electric vehicles (EVs). The system is designed to go through several stages: from the grid to the AC filter, then to the AC/DC conversion, followed by the DC-link, DC/DC conversion, and finally to the battery.

## Repository Hierarchy

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- [**AC_DC_Conversion**](./AC-DC_Conversion): Contains all the files and scripts related to the AC to DC conversion process.
- [**DC_DC_Conversion**](./DC-DC_conversion): Includes the components and code for the DC to DC conversion phase.
- [**Charger_Integration**](./Charger_Integration): Integrates all the components of the charger system.
- [**Documentation**](./Documentation): Comprehensive documentation of the project, including design decisions, testing procedures, and user guides.
- [**media**](./media): Contains all the media files, including images and diagrams used in the README and documentation.

## Project Phases

1. **Grid Connection**: Connection from the grid to the system.
2. **AC Filter**: Filtering the alternating current.
3. **AC/DC Conversion**: Converting alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).
4. **DC-Link**: Stabilizing the DC voltage.
5. **DC/DC Conversion**: Converting to the required DC voltage levels.
6. **Battery Charging**: Charging the electric vehicle battery.
