# AC/DC Conversion

The AC/DC conversion is a crucial part of the off-board charger for electric vehicles (EVs). This process converts the alternating current (AC) from the grid into direct current (DC) required for charging the EV battery. Proper AC-DC conversion ensures efficient and safe power transfer, minimizing losses and ensuring the battery receives a stable and appropriate voltage level.

## Repository Hierarchy

The AC-DC_Conversion directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- [*Simulations*](./Simulations): Contains simulation models related to the AC/DC conversion process.
- [*Practical_Work*](./Practical_Work): Includes practical Simulink models of the AC/DC conversion process.

Feel free to explore these subdirectories to find detailed information and data on the AC/DC conversion phase of the project.
