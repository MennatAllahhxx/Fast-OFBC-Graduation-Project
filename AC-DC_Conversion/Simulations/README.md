# Simulations

This directory contains MATLAB Simulink models for the AC/DC converters used in the off-board charger for electric vehicles (EVs). Each model is designed for a different power rating, demonstrating the scalability and flexibility of our AC-DC conversion process.

## Repository Hierarchy

The Simulations directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- [*10K_LCL-Filter*](./10K_LCL-Filter): Contains the MATLAB Simulink model for the AC/DC converter designed for a 10 kW power rating.
- [*1K_LCL-Filter*](./1K_LCL-Filter): Contains the MATLAB Simulink model for the AC/DC converter designed for a 1 kW power rating.

Feel free to explore these subdirectories to find detailed simulation models and results for the respective AC/DC converters.
