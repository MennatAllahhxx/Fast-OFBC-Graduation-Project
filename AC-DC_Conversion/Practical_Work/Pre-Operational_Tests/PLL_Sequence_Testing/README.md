# PLL Sequence Testing

This subdirectory contains tests and calibration procedures for the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) sequence in the AC/DC conversion stage of the off-board charger project. The model used for this testing is `pll_sequence_test.slx`.

## Important Note

Before performing the PLL sequence test, ensure that the voltage sensors test has been successfully completed. The PLL sequence test relies on accurate voltage measurements, which are calibrated in the voltage sensors testing phase.

## Calibration Procedure for PLL Sequence

The PLL sequence test is essential for ensuring that the phase angle is correctly synchronized with the input signals. Follow these steps to perform the test using MATLAB Simulink:

1. **Open the Simulink Model**: 
   - Open the provided Simulink model (`pll_sequence_test.slx`) in MATLAB.

2. **Verify Voltage Sensor Calibration**:
   - Ensure that the voltage sensors are calibrated accurately as described in the [Voltage Sensors Testing README](../Voltage_Sensors_Testing/README.md).

3. **Real-Time Calibration using Monitor and Tune Option**:
   - Utilize the Monitor and Tune option in Simulink to adjust calibration parameters while monitoring the PLL outputs in real-time.

4. **Exchange Phases for Sawtooth Waveform**:
   - Run the Simulink model and monitor the phase angle output.
   - Exchange the phases until the phase angle output forms a sawtooth waveform, indicating proper synchronization.

5. **PLL Block**:
   - Note that the PLL block used in this model is generated by MATLAB 2019. Ensure compatibility if using a different version of MATLAB.

### Important Considerations

- **Accurate Voltage Measurements**: The PLL sequence test relies on the accuracy of the voltage sensors. Ensure that the voltage sensor calibration is precise.
  
- **Real-Time Adjustment**: Use the Monitor and Tune option for real-time adjustments to achieve the desired phase angle waveform.
