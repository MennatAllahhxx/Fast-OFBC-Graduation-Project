# Charger Integration

This directory contains the integration models for the off-board charger for electric vehicles (EVs). The integration involves connecting the active-front-end (AFE) rectifier with different types of DC/DC converters to achieve efficient power conversion and delivery.

## Repository Hierarchy

The `Charger_Integration` directory is organized into the following subdirectories:

- [**AFE_DAB**](./AFE_DAB): Contains the integration between the active-front-end rectifier and the Dual Active Bridge (DAB) DC/DC converter.
- [**AFE_LLC**](./AFE_LLC): Contains the integration between the active-front-end rectifier and the LLC (inductor-inductor-capacitor) DC/DC converter.
